This section is dedicated to detailing our approach towards cookies and providing guidance on their management.\n\nIf you&#8217;re already familiar with the cookie universe and wish to tweak your preferences, simply navigate to your account settings within the app and modify your privacy selections there.\nEager to delve deeper into our cookie practices? Dive right in!\n\nPlease be aware: this Cookie Guidelines section primarily deals with our use of cookies. For comprehensive information about how we handle your personal data, kindly refer to our Privacy Guidelines.\n<h4>So, What Exactly are Cookies?<\/h4>\nThink of cookies as tiny text-based notes. They are transmitted to, or read from, your web browser or device storage. Typically, a cookie includes the domain it hails from, its expiration or &#8216;life-span&#8217;, and a distinct identifier, often a random number. Cookies can also store data regarding your device, such as user preferences, browsing habits, and interactions during the use of our services.\n<h4>Are All Cookies Created Equal?<\/h4>\nNo, there are a few categories:\n<ul>\n \t<li>First-party vs. Third-party Cookies: Direct cookies are those that we place on your device. These allow us to, for instance, set our website to your preferred language and understand your interaction with our platform. Indirect, or third-party, cookies are set by our associates and external service providers. Get to know these entities better through our website and the in-app cookie management tools.<\/li>\n \t<li>Session vs. Persistent Cookies: While session cookies bid farewell once you close your browser, persistent cookies stick around longer. The former assists us in gaining insights during a single browsing session, ensuring smoother navigation. The latter, with its extended existence, aids in swift log-ins and provides analytical insights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>And What About Other Digital Trackers?<\/h4>\nThere are other players like web beacons (pixels, tags, or clear gifs), tracking URLs, and software development kits (SDKs) that function similarly to cookies. For instance, web beacons are minuscule graphic entities that let us know when someone uses our service or checks an email from us. Tracking URLs show us the origin of our website traffic, while SDKs in apps mirror the behaviour of cookies and web beacons.\n\nTo keep things streamlined, we&#8217;ll address these technologies as &#8220;cookies&#8221; within these guidelines.\n<h4>Why Do We Rely on Cookies?<\/h4>\nJust like many digital service providers, cookies assist us in enhancing, securing, and personalising our services. This includes recalling your settings, acknowledging repeat visitors, gauging our promotional strategies, and fine-tuning ads based on your interests. Occasionally, we might link cookie data with other personal info we have on file for you.\nDuring your use of Tandem, various cookies may find their way to your device.\n<h4>Cookie Type<\/h4>\n<strong>Essential cookies<\/strong>\n\nThese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you our services, such as enabling you to log in, remembering your preferences and keeping you safe by detecting malicious activity.\n\n<strong>Analytics cookies<\/strong>\n\nThese cookies help us understand how our services are being used and help us customise and improve our services for you.\n\n<strong>Advertising &amp; marketing cookies<\/strong>\n\nThese cookies are used to determine how effective our marketing campaigns are and make the ads you see more relevant to you. They perform functions like helping us understand how much traffic our marketing campaigns drive on our services, preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, selecting advertisements relevant to you and measuring the number of ads displayed and their performance, such as how many people interacted with a given ad.\n\n<strong>Social networking cookies<\/strong>\n\nThese cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our services through third-party social networking and other websites or services. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.\n<h4>How can you control cookies?<\/h4>\nThere are several cookie management options available to you. Please note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may result in using our services becoming a less satisfying experience, as they may no longer be as personalised. In some cases, you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our services.\n<h4>Tools we provide<\/h4>\nYou can set and adjust your cookie preferences at any time by heading to your account settings in the app and adjusting your app cookie preferences there.\n\n<strong>Browser and device controls<\/strong>\n\nSome web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies, or that alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for each Internet browser. You can check the specific steps in your particular browser\u2019s help menu.\n\nYou may also be able to reset device identifiers or opt out from having identifiers collected or processed by using the appropriate setting on your mobile device. The procedures for managing identifiers are slightly different for each device. You can check the specific steps in the help or settings menu of your particular device.\n\n<strong>Interest-based advertising tools<\/strong>\n\nAdvertising companies may participate in self-regulatory programmes that allow you to opt out of any interest-based ads involving them. For more information on this, you can visit the following sites: Digital Advertising Alliance; Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance; App choices (apps only).\n\nOpting out does not mean you will not see advertising \u2013 it means you won\u2019t see personalised advertising from the companies that participate in these opt-out programmes. Also, if you delete cookies on your device after you\u2019ve opted out, you will need to opt out again.\n<h4>Google\u2122 Cookies<\/h4>\n<strong>Google\u2122 Maps API Cookies<\/strong>\n\nSome features of our website and some Tandem services rely on the use of Google\u2122 Maps API Cookies. Such cookies will be stored on your device.\nWhen browsing this website and using the services relying on Google\u2122 Maps API cookies, you consent to the storage and collection of such cookies on your device and to the access, usage and sharing by Google of the data collected thereby.\n\nGoogle\u2122 manages the information and your choices pertaining to Google\u2122 Maps API Cookies via an interface separate from that supplied by your browser. For more information, please see https:\/\/www.google.com\/policies\/technologies\/cookies\/.\n\n<strong>Google Analytics<\/strong>\n\nWe use Google Analytics \u2013 a Google service that uses cookies and other data collection technologies to collect information about your use of the website and services, in order to report website trends.\nFor more information on how Google collects and processes data, visit\u00a0https:\/\/policies.google.com\/technologies\/partner-sites.\u00a0You can opt out of Google Analytics by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at\u00a0https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/gaoptout\u00a0and opt out of Google\u2019s ad personalisation at\u00a0https:\/\/adssettings.google.com\/.\n<h4>Managing Cookies<\/h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Overview: We offer multiple options for cookie management. However, altering cookie preferences might affect your experience, potentially limiting service functionalities.<\/li>\n \t<li>Our Tools: Modify cookie preferences using the tool on our website or via account settings in the app.<\/li>\n \t<li>Browser &amp; Device Controls: Browsers let you control or be alerted about cookies. For guidance, refer to your browser&#8217;s help menu. Mobile devices allow resetting or opting out of identifier collection via device settings.<\/li>\n \t<li>Interest-Based Ads:\nSome advertisers allow opt-outs from personalised ads. Visit Digital Advertising Alliance, Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, and Appchoices for details.\nOpting out means non-personalised ads. Clearing cookies requires re-opting.<\/li>\n \t<li>Google Cookies:\nGoogle\u2122 Maps API Cookies: Used by our services. By browsing, you consent to their storage and Google&#8217;s data usage. Google provides separate cookie management; more details at Google&#8217;s cookie policies.\nGoogle Analytics: Helps us track website trends. Understand Google&#8217;s data use at Google&#8217;s partner sites policy. Opt-out with Google Analytics browser add-on or adjust Google\u2019s ad personalisation.<\/li>\n \t<li>Contact: For questions about our Cookie Policy, reach out to us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-scroll-anim elementor-element elementor-element-4ab53d7 elementor-widget__width-initial elementor-absolute elementor-hidden-tablet elementor-hidden-mobile elementor-view-default elementor-widget elementor-widget-icon\" data-move-in=\"moveVertical\" data-move-out=\"moveVertical\" data-axis-x=\"2\" data-axis-y=\"30\" data-rotate=\"90\" data-scale=\"1\" data-vp-top=\"0.1\" data-vp-bot=\"0.1\" data-el-top=\"0.1\" data-scroll-animation-off=\"1024\" data-id=\"4ab53d7\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-settings=\"{&quot;_position&quot;:&quot;absolute&quot;,&quot;ekit_we_effect_on&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}\" data-widget_type=\"icon.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-icon-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-icon\">\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"36\" height=\"43\" viewBox=\"0 0 36 43\" fill=\"none\"><g opacity=\"0.1\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M9.09328 27.8343C9.09864 27.8942 9.11222 27.9582 9.13006 28.0141C9.2133 28.2746 9.40685 28.4927 9.66196 28.6019L28.2864 36.6625C28.5991 36.8011 28.9515 36.7625 29.2337 36.5687C29.5159 36.3749 29.6674 36.0522 29.6494 35.7158L28.4286 14.3826C28.4047 14.0276 28.1939 13.7125 27.8648 13.5656C27.5357 13.4187 27.1583 13.4653 26.8696 13.6818L9.47018 26.9461C9.20018 27.1565 9.05458 27.4978 9.09328 27.8343ZM11.1001 27.5834L26.9845 15.4791L28.0972 34.9448L11.1001 27.5834Z\" fill=\"#191E56\"><\/path><path d=\"M6.11452 14.0914L5.02118 11.4698L2.42415 12.5687C2.0501 12.7257 1.61105 12.5468 1.45489 12.1693C1.44868 12.1499 1.44247 12.1305 1.4342 12.1046C1.31834 11.7425 1.49245 11.3363 1.84727 11.1856L4.4443 10.0867L3.35095 7.46511C3.34475 7.44571 3.33854 7.42631 3.33027 7.40045C3.21234 7.03188 3.38852 6.63219 3.74334 6.48147C4.11739 6.32452 4.55644 6.50333 4.7126 6.88091L5.80595 9.5025L8.40298 8.40358C8.77702 8.24662 9.21607 8.42544 9.37224 8.80302C9.5284 9.1806 9.35183 9.62323 8.97778 9.78019L6.38075 10.8791L7.4741 13.5007C7.63027 13.8783 7.45369 14.3209 7.07965 14.4779C6.70974 14.6478 6.27916 14.4733 6.11452 14.0914Z\" fill=\"#191E56\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg>\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cookie Policy Updated 25th November 2023 Cookie Guidelines for Tandem At Tandem, transparency is at our core, especially when it comes to the data we gather and how we handle it.
